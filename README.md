# bp/ Client
Blueprint's URL shortner

Note: The chrome store now requires all extensions to migrate to Manifest V3 to be on the chrome extension store. I think there are limitations with the new API, so bp/ might show your google search before taking you to the actual bp/ page. I'm not sure if there is a way to fix this, but if anyone would like to take a look that would be appreciated!
